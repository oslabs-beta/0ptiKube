# Purpose: Monitors the bank's processing system health
# - Checks system every 10 seconds (like real-time banking monitoring)
# - Tracks important metrics:
#   * Memory usage (detect memory leaks from transaction processing)
#   * CPU usage (ensure processing power is available)
#   * System health (prevent banking service disruptions)
# - Similar to a bank's monitoring dashboard that alerts operators
#   when system resources are running low
