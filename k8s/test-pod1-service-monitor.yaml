# Purpose: Configures Prometheus to scrape metrics from the test pod
# - Tells Prometheus which pods to monitor
# - Sets scraping interval and timeout - checks metrics every 15 seconds 
# - Defines metrics endpoint and port
# - Links to prometheus operator via labels

# Narrative: Monitors e-commerce web server performance
# - Checks system every 15 seconds (standard web server monitoring interval)
# - Tracks critical web server metrics:
#   * CPU usage (for request handling capacity)
#   * Memory usage (for session management)
#   * System health (ensure responsive customer experience)
# - Similar to a production web monitoring system that ensures
#   customers have a smooth shopping experience
